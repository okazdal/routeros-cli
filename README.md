# routeros-cli
MikroTik API CLI in Rust

This is a project to practice on Rust. 

Usage example:
./routeros-cli 192.168.1.1 8728 <username> <password>

Then enter your api command followed with a blank line.

## Issues:

- Currently it does not support SSL. I will make SSL version.
- I could not get it working with /log/listen command. Still working on it.
